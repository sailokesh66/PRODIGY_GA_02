# PRODIGY_GA_02
Text to image generation using pretrained diffusion model 

🚀 Overview
This project explores AI-powered image generation using a pre-trained diffusion model to create stunning visuals from text prompts. As part of my internship, I experimented with generative models to produce unique AI-generated images.

🎨 Example Prompt
📝 "A wildflower during sunrise on an alien planet."

Using this prompt, the model generates a visually striking scene with an extraterrestrial landscape, blending creativity and AI-driven artistry.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 🐍
Stable Diffusion (via diffusers library)
Torch (PyTorch) for deep learning acceleration
CUDA (for GPU-optimized inference)

📌 How It Works
Load a Pre-Trained Diffusion Model – The model is pre-trained on vast datasets and can generate high-quality images from text descriptions.
Generate an Image from a Text Prompt – AI refines random noise into a meaningful image based on the given input.
Save and Display the Image – The generated artwork is stored as an output file.
